" What this does is it creates a new operator "z" that forcibly acts as a
" normal "w". This "w" is then mapped (only for cw, aka the "error") to cw to
" fix it. However it works perfectly fine with dw as well. It takes just one
" command history so undo works properly and dot repetition works as expected.
